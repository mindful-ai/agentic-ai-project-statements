Questions: Group A 

Univariate Analysis Questions
Univariate analysis focuses on examining a single variable at a time. 
Key goals include understanding its distribution, central tendency, variability, 
and identifying outliers.

What is the distribution of each continuous variable in the dataset?
Example: What is the distribution of age in the Student Performance dataset?
This helps reveal skewness, modality, and spread of the data.

Are there any outliers in each continuous variable?
Example: Are there outliers in the absences variable?
Identifying outliers helps understand any extreme values that might need special treatment.

What is the central tendency (mean, median, mode) and spread (variance, standard deviation) of continuous variables?
Example: What are the mean and median of studytime?
This can help identify if the data is symmetric or skewed and its variability.

How frequent are the categories for each categorical variable?
Example: How many students are in each category of school (GP vs. MS)?
Frequency counts show the distribution of categorical values, helping understand sample sizes within each group.

What is the proportion of students who participate in extracurricular activities?
Example: What percentage of students participate in activities?
Understanding proportions in binary variables gives insight into participation levels or response rates.

How are binary variables (yes/no) distributed in the dataset?
Example: What is the distribution of internet access among students?
This helps understand access rates and availability of resources in the dataset.

What is the distribution of student grades across different intervals?
Example: How are grades (G3) distributed across low, medium, and high categories?
This can involve creating bins for continuous variables and helps understand the grading trend.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions: Group B 

Bivariate analysis examines the relationship between two variables. 
It can reveal correlations, patterns, and interactions, especially for 
understanding how one variable might affect another.

Is there a correlation between age and final grade (G3)?
This tests if there’s a relationship between student age and their academic performance.

How does the number of study hours (studytime) impact final grades (G3)?
Understanding this relationship can reveal if more study time is associated with higher grades.

Does the number of absences correlate with students’ grades?
Example: Are students with more absences likely to have lower grades?
This examines the effect of attendance on academic performance.

What is the relationship between parental education level and student grades?
Example: How does Medu (mother’s education) correlate with final grade (G3)?
Helps assess if higher parental education is associated with higher student performance.

Does family structure (Pstatus) impact student grades?
Example: Is there a difference in average grade (G3) between students living with both parents vs. one parent?
This helps understand if family support impacts academic performance.

How does alcohol consumption (weekend vs. weekday) affect student grades?
Examining Dalc (weekday drinking) and Walc (weekend drinking) with G3 can show if alcohol consumption patterns correlate with academic outcomes.

Is there a difference in grades between students who have internet access at home and those who don’t?
This examines whether internet access is associated with higher grades.

How do grades vary across different schools?
Example: Are students from school GP outperforming those from school MS?
School-wise comparison of grades to see if one school has a performance advantage.

What is the relationship between average household size and average student performance?
This explores if family size (e.g., famsize) impacts student grades, possibly due to resource distribution.

Does parental job type (Mjob/Fjob) affect student grades?
Example: Are students whose parents work in specific professions performing better academically?
This examines potential socioeconomic influences on performance.

How do study time and going out time correlate with each other?
Examining studytime and goout helps reveal if students who study more also go out less, which may indirectly affect grades.

Does health status influence students’ grades?
Example: Do students who report better health status (health) tend to have better grades (G3)?
This investigates if health is a factor in academic performance.

Are there any gender-based differences in final grades?
Example: Is there a significant difference in average grades (G3) between male and female students?
Analyzing gender differences in performance can highlight if gender impacts grades.

How does weekday alcohol consumption relate to weekend alcohol consumption?
Exploring Dalc vs. Walc helps understand if students who drink during weekdays also drink more on weekends.

Does travel time to school affect students’ study time?
Example: Do students who travel longer to school tend to have less study time?
This relationship might show if commute time indirectly affects academic preparation.

Questions: Group C

What is the distribution of final grades (G3) among students?
An initial look at how grades are distributed across all students, 
which can reveal overall performance levels and grade skewness.

How do demographic factors like age and gender influence final grades?
Investigate if there are any noticeable differences in performance based 
on age or gender, potentially identifying trends for different groups.

What is the relationship between parental education levels and student performance?
Explore if students whose parents have higher education levels tend to perform better, 
which may hint at socioeconomic influences.

How does the number of study hours affect students' final grades?
Analyze if students who study more frequently (represented by study time) 
achieve higher grades, providing insight into the impact of study habits.

Is there any correlation between alcohol consumption and student performance?
Examine if students who consume alcohol more frequently (using the Dalc and Walc variables 
for weekday and weekend consumption) tend to have lower grades.

How does family structure (living with both parents vs. one parent) impact student grades?
Investigate if family structure has any effect on academic performance, 
which could reveal the importance of household stability.

Does a student’s commute time to school affect their performance?
Analyze if longer commute times correlate with lower grades, 
potentially indicating a negative impact of travel on students’ academic results.

What is the effect of extracurricular activities on academic performance?
Check if students involved in extracurricular activities 
(represented by the activities feature) tend to perform better or worse academically.

Are there significant differences in performance between students in different schools?
Compare the grades of students from the two schools 
(GP and MS) to see if one school outperforms the other.

How does access to educational resources (such as internet access) influence grades?
Determine if students with internet access at home (represented by the internet feature) 
achieve higher grades, possibly reflecting the benefit of additional resources.

What is the relationship between parental job types and student grades?
Examine if the type of job a parent has (using the Mjob and Fjob features) 
is associated with student performance.

Does the amount of time students spend going out socially correlate with academic performance?
Analyze if students who spend more time going out with friends (using the goout feature) 
have different performance levels than those who socialize less.

How does the quality of family relationships influence student grades?
Investigate if students who report better family relationships (using the famrel feature) 
achieve higher grades, potentially showing the role of family support in academic success.

Is there any pattern in performance based on a student’s health status?
Explore if students with better self-reported health (using the health feature) 
tend to perform better in their final grades, indicating a possible link between health and academic success.

What is the impact of absences on student performance?
Check if students with higher absence counts tend to have lower final grades, 
which could show the importance of attendance for academic success.
