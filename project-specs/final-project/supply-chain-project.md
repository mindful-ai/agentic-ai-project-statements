Multi-Tool AI Agent for Supply Chain Optimization using LangChain and LangGraph
Project Overview
This capstone project challenges participants to build an advanced Multi-Tool Agentic AI System using LangChain and LangGraph to optimize various stages of supply chain management â€” including demand forecasting, inventory control, supplier analysis, and logistics coordination. The project will incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agentic workflows, and predictive modeling for decision-making.

Project Objectives
Automate insights and recommendations for supply chain decisions.

Integrate real-time and historical data from multiple sources.

Build an agentic pipeline that interacts with tools such as search, calculators, APIs, and RAG chains.

Enable reasoning-based conversation for what-if analysis, supplier ranking, logistics simulations, etc.

Project Timeline and Task Breakdown
ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Requirement Analysis and Use Case Framing (Day 1)
Identify supply chain problem statements to address (e.g., demand variability, supplier performance).

Define personas (e.g., logistics manager, procurement head).

Draft the main queries and decisions the agent should support.

ðŸ“Œ Deliverables:

Problem Statement Document

Agent Use Case Flowchart

ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Data Collection and Curation (Days 2â€“3)
Collect and structure multi-source data for supply chain optimization:

Data Source	Data Types to Collect	Examples
1. Kaggle Datasets (Supply Chain, Inventory)	Product demand, inventory levels, supplier logs	Daily demand data for 100 SKUs
2. Public APIs (e.g., Transport, Trade APIs)	Real-time delivery tracking, port delays	Average shipment time from port A to B
3. News Websites and Blogs (via Web Scraping)	Supply chain risks, raw material updates	"Steel prices increased by 30% due to XYZ"
4. Company Reports and CSR Disclosures	Supplier reliability, sustainability reports	Supplier A: 85% on-time delivery rate, ISO certifications
5. Synthetic or Simulated Logistics Data	Delivery schedules, fleet availability	Route optimization data for 5 logistics hubs

ðŸ“Œ Deliverables:

Raw Data Files (CSV/JSON)

Cleaned Data Artifacts

Documented Data Dictionary

ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Embedding Generation and Vector Store Setup (Day 4)
Process and chunk textual data (news, reports, logs).

Convert into embeddings using OpenAI, Hugging Face, or similar.

Store in ChromaDB, Weaviate, or FAISS.

ðŸ“Œ Deliverables:

Embedded Vector Store

Summary of Embedding Pipeline

ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Predictive Model Development (Day 5)
Choose ML models for:

Demand forecasting (e.g., Prophet, XGBoost)

Supplier risk scoring (e.g., logistic regression, random forest)

Delivery time estimation (e.g., regression models)

ðŸ“Œ Deliverables:

Trained Models and Notebooks

Evaluation Metrics and Plots

ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Tool-Integrated Agent with LangChain & LangGraph (Days 6â€“7)
Develop an Agentic AI that:

Uses RAG to answer queries on suppliers, risk, logistics

Calls forecasting model for future inventory estimation

Integrates calculator and search tools

Uses LangGraph for conditional, multi-step reasoning

ðŸ“Œ Deliverables:

LangChain Agent Script with Tools

LangGraph Workflow Diagrams

RAG Chain Configurations

ðŸ”¹ Task 6: Deployment and Testing (Day 8)
Build a Streamlit, Gradio, or FastAPI interface

Host agent locally or on Hugging Face Spaces

Test with real-time prompts and scenario walkthroughs

ðŸ“Œ Deliverables:

UI/UX Frontend App

Demo Video (2â€“3 mins)

Prompt Examples and Results

ðŸ”¹ Task 7: Final Report and Presentation (Day 9)
Summarize system design, agent flow, tools used

Show quantitative impact (e.g., prediction accuracy, latency)

Highlight limitations and future enhancements

ðŸ“Œ Deliverables:

Final Report (PDF/DOCX)

Slide Deck (10â€“15 slides)

Live Demo
