# Project Specification: Job Salary Prediction

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a regression model to predict job salaries based on job descriptions and other structured features. The project will involve text preprocessing, feature engineering, combining text with structured data, and interpreting the model’s outputs.

## Dataset Suggestion

Use the "Job Salary Prediction" dataset from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/c/job-salary-prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/c/job-salary-prediction)

## Task-Wise Steps

### Task 1: Data Loading and Initial Exploration
- Load the dataset using pandas.
- Display top rows and understand the structure.
- Check for missing values and basic statistics.

### Task 2: Text Cleaning
- Focus on job description column.
- Convert to lowercase.
- Remove punctuation and special characters.
- Remove stop words.
- Tokenize and clean the text.

### Task 3: Feature Engineering from Text
- Create features such as:
  - Word count
  - Character count
  - Presence of specific keywords (e.g., “Python”, “Manager”, “remote”)
  - Number of capitalized words

### Task 4: Encoding Categorical Features
- Use label encoding or one-hot encoding for categorical columns like industry, job type, etc.
- Analyze the cardinality of each categorical column before choosing the encoding method.

### Task 5: Text Vectorization
- Use `CountVectorizer` to convert cleaned job descriptions into numerical features.
- Use `TfidfVectorizer` as a second experiment.
- Limit the number of features (e.g., max_features=1000).

### Task 6: Feature Combination
- Combine the numerical features from text vectorization with structured data (categorical + numerical features).
- Use `scikit-learn`’s `hstack` or `ColumnTransformer` for integration.

### Task 7: Model Building and Training
- Split the dataset into training and test sets.
- Use models such as `LinearRegression`, `Ridge`, `RandomForestRegressor`, and compare results.
- Evaluate performance using RMSE, MAE, and R².

### Task 8: Feature Importance and Interpretability
- Use `SHAP` or `permutation importance` to interpret which features contribute most to predictions.
- Visualize important keywords or categorical variables.
