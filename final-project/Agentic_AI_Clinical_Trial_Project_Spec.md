# Agentic AI for Clinical Trial Exploration: Automating Search, Summarization, and Reasoning

## Overview

This capstone project involves building an **Agentic AI system powered by LangGraph and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to assist researchers in exploring, summarizing, and reasoning over clinical trial information. The system should automate search across trial registries, summarize key findings, and support reasoning-based queries (e.g., comparing treatments or outcomes).

---

## Objectives

1. Collect and process relevant clinical trial datasets.
2. Extract structured and unstructured data for machine learning and NLP modeling.
3. Build a system for search, summarization, and reasoning using Agentic AI with LangGraph.
4. Use embeddings and vector databases for efficient retrieval.
5. Enable interaction through a user-friendly agent interface.

## Task-wise Breakdown

### **Task 1: Data Collection **

**Objective:** Identify and collect relevant clinical trial datasets and supplementary biomedical data.

**Sources to be used:**
- [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov)
- [WHO ICTRP](https://trialsearch.who.int/)
- [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
- [OpenTrials](https://opentrials.net/)
- [FDA Drug Trials Snapshots](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/drug-trials-snapshots)

**Data to collect:**
- Clinical trial protocols
- Summary results and outcomes
- Eligibility criteria
- Study interventions
- Associated publications (abstracts, papers)
- Trial statuses and phase information

**Deliverables:**
- `raw_data/` directory with downloaded datasets and metadata
- Data source documentation

---

### **Task 2: Data Processing & Preparation **

**Objective:** Clean and transform raw data into usable formats for RAG and machine learning models.

**Subtasks:**
- Parse structured XML/JSON data from ClinicalTrials.gov.
- Extract text for summarization: eligibility criteria, study outcomes, interventions.
- Normalize terminologies (e.g., disease names, drugs).
- Store documents in chunked format for embedding generation.

**Deliverables:**
- `processed_data/` directory with structured and text-processed files
- Scripts/notebooks for parsing and transformation

---

### **Task 3: Embedding Generation and Vector DB Setup **

**Objective:** Generate embeddings from trial texts and load into a vector database for retrieval.

**Embedding generation examples:**
- `"This trial evaluates the efficacy of drug X in reducing systolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients"` → Embedding vector
- `"Inclusion: Age 18–65, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes"` → Embedding vector

**Tools:**
- `OpenAI Embeddings` or `Sentence-BERT`
- `FAISS` or `Chroma` or `Pinecone`

**Deliverables:**
- Code for chunking and embedding generation
- Vector DB instance containing clinical trial texts

---

### **Task 4: RAG and LangGraph-based Agent Development **

**Objective:** Build an Agentic AI system that leverages RAG and LangGraph for intelligent interactions.

**Features:**
- Question-answering about trial objectives, outcomes, side effects, etc.
- Summarization of trials on a specific disease (e.g., cancer)
- Reasoning: “Which treatment showed better results for melanoma?”

**LangGraph Toolchain Examples:**
- `SearchTool`: to retrieve from vector DB
- `SummaryTool`: to condense findings
- `ReasonTool`: to evaluate efficacy and compare trials

**Deliverables:**
- LangGraph agent script or notebook
- Sample conversations showing reasoning and summarization

---

### **Task 5: Machine Learning Modeling **

**Objective:** Build ML models for trial outcome prediction, e.g., success probability, dropout rate.

**Examples:**
- Classification: Will the trial complete successfully? (Yes/No)
- Regression: Predict dropout % based on criteria and location

**Suggested Features:**
- Trial duration, phase, condition, intervention type
- Number of participants, location, sponsor type

**Deliverables:**
- ML pipeline code and model artifact
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, etc.)

---

### **Task 6: Final Integration, UI Layer and Demo **

**Objective:** Integrate the full pipeline and demonstrate the Agentic AI system.

**Components to include:**
- Streamlit application
- LangGraph-based agent
- Vector DB retrieval
- Summarization interface
- ML insights integration

**Deliverables:**
- Working application or notebook demo
- README with instructions
- Final presentation
